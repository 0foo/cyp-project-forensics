# Stage reference

One section per stage. Each gives the inputs, the exact command, the outputs, the runtime,
and what goes wrong. File formats are specified separately in
[`03-data-contracts.md`](03-data-contracts.md).

Legend: **✅ committed** — code is in this repository. **❌ missing** — the stage was run, but
its code was never committed and survives only in the archive photographs.

---

## Stage 0 — Preparing the inputs ❌

Before stage 1 can start, each species needs two things, and one of them requires work that
is not in this repository.

### 0a. Genome FASTA

Per-species assemblies, named by their NCBI accession — e.g.
`GCF_016746245.2_Prin_Dsan_1.1_genomic.fna` (*D. santomea*),
`Drosophila_ananassae.GCF_017639315.1` (*D. ananassae*).

Era 1 read these from `D:/CYP_Gene_Project/Dhakad_et_al_2025_Data_Analysis/12_species_genomes`,
described in the log as the *old* location superseded by `Spring26/` *(OCR doc 04)* — but the
JBrowse instructions and the handoff sketch both still point at the `Dhakad` tree *(OCR docs
02, 06)*, so the genome FASTAs appear never to have actually moved.

Era 2's `worker.sh` expects them **gzipped** in `IN_DIR`, matching `GLOB` (default `*.fna.gz`).

### 0b. Gene annotation GFF3 with *D. melanogaster* ortholog names ❌

This is the important one. Each species' annotation must have its gene names replaced with
the corresponding *D. melanogaster* ortholog symbols, producing files named
`*_withDmelNames.gff`. Without it, the same gene carries a different symbol in every species
and nothing can be compared across species — and the Cyp target list would match nothing.

**Two different scripts did this, by two different people, and neither is committed** — both
have since been recovered into `to_organize/`; `ReVamp_Final.py` is documented, and verified by
re-running it, in [`deep/06-final-final-gff.md`](../../deep/06-final-final-gff.md):

| Dataset | Script | Author | Location | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gff_Dataset#1 | `NEW_Step_5_Replace_gff_Names_with_Dmelanogaster_1_9.py` | Ayush (editing the log author's older scripts) | `CYP_Gene_Project/Spring26/Gff_Dataset#1` | 5/7/2026 |
| Gff_Dataset#2 | `ReVamp_Final.py` | Duy | `CYP_Gene_Project/Spring26/Gff_Dataset#2` | 7/9/2026 |

*(OCR doc 04; folder dates from OCR doc 03b.)*

Nothing in the log states which supersedes which. The lab notebook's step-by-step procedure
points at **Dataset #2**, so that is the one that was in active use as of August 2026
*(OCR doc 02)*. `Gff_Dataset#2` is only 278 KB and contains a single subfolder,
`Duy_New_Scripts` — it is a script folder, not a data folder, despite the name *(OCR doc 03b)*.

**If you need to rebuild this step**, you need the ortholog mapping as well as the code. The
committed example output shows `dmel_orthologs=` and `hog=N1.HOG…` attributes on mRNA
records. Those come from the published Zenodo annotations (record 18453526), not from this
step; this step only swaps gene IDs for the Dmel symbol of the same HOG.

### 0c. The Cyp target list ✅

`pipeline-scripts-output/AnalysisForAll/Reg_Gene_Full.txt` — 96 lines, one gene symbol each.

Two of its properties are load-bearing and non-obvious: it contains five entries in
`Dvir\GJ21722` form which **both** stage 3 scripts silently skip (they skip every line
starting with `D`), and matching is *substring* matching, not exact — see
[`03-data-contracts.md`](03-data-contracts.md).

`pipeline-scripts-output/DA_Files/` also holds `Cyp_stable_genes_Good_et_al_2014.txt` and
`Cyp_unstable_genes_Good_et_al_2014.txt`, a literature-derived split of Cyp genes into
evolutionarily stable and unstable sets. Nothing in the committed code reads them.

---

## Stage 1 — Build the per-species repeat library ✅

**In:** one genome FASTA. **Out:** a classified TE consensus library. **Runtime:** 8-26 h
typical, 45 h observed with `-LTRStruct`.

### Era 1 — as originally run ❌ (documented for reference)

`spinContainer.sh`, transcribed in full from a terminal photograph *(OCR doc 01)*:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/Spring26RepeatModeler \
    -w /Spring26RepeatModeler \
    dfam/tetools:latest bash
```

This starts an **interactive** shell — it does not run RepeatModeler. The operator then typed,
inside the container *(OCR doc 04)*:

```
BuildDatabase -name D_speciesname Species_genome_file.fa
RepeatModeler -database D_speciesname -threads 10 -LTRStruct
```

Because `-v $(pwd):...` mounts only the current species folder, running a second species meant
opening a second terminal and repeating the entire sequence. `--rm` means nothing survives
outside the mount.

### Era 2 — the committed automation ✅

`repeat-modeler-automation/`. Configuration is **entirely** in `rmodeler.conf`; there are no
command-line options and no environment variables, and inherited environment values are
discarded before the file is read. Both scripts exit 2 if the file is missing, if a setting is
missing, if a name is misspelled, or if a value is nonsense.

```bash
cp rmodeler.conf.example rmodeler.conf && $EDITOR rmodeler.conf
docker pull dfam/tetools:latest

./worker.sh                  # one worker, foreground — good for a first run
./rm-manager.sh start        # WORKERS workers as daemons
./rm-manager.sh status       # pid check + queue counts
./rm-manager.sh stop         # SIGTERM all of them
```

Per genome the worker performs, inside the container:

```
BuildDatabase -name <sample> <sample>.fa
RepeatModeler -database <sample> <thread flag> [-LTRStruct]
```

and then, when `RUN_MASKER=1`, continues straight into stage 2 on the same genome without
releasing the claim — see [Stage 2](#stage-2--annotate-te-locations-genome-wide-).

Differences from era 1 that matter:

- **No `-engine` flag**, on either call. Current RepeatModeler (checked against 2.0.9) removed
  the option from `BuildDatabase`, so passing it is a hard `Unknown option: engine` failure.
- **The thread flag is detected at runtime** (`-threads` vs the older `-pa`) rather than
  assumed.
- **Decompression happens on the host**, so `IN_DIR` is never mounted into the container — a
  container only ever sees one genome's scratch directory.
- **The result is verified, not assumed.** RepeatModeler can exit 0 having produced nothing
  usable, so the worker checks that `<sample>-families.fa` is non-empty before declaring
  success.

### Outputs

| Path | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `$OUT_DIR/<sample>-families.fa` (and `.stk`) | The library. The only artifact that leaves the stage |
| `$STATE_DIR/done/<sample>` | Finished successfully |
| `$STATE_DIR/failed/<sample>` | Failed; scratch dir and log kept for inspection |
| `$STATE_DIR/claimed/<sample>/owner` | In progress; records host + pid |
| `$LOG_DIR/<sample>.log` | Full BuildDatabase/RepeatModeler output |
| `$WORK_DIR/<sample>/` | Scratch; deleted on success unless `KEEP_WORK=1`, kept on failure |

Era 1's equivalent output was `consensi.fa.classified`, alongside `families.stk`, `rmod.log`,
`round-1`…`round-5`, `genome.2bit` and assorted `tmp*` files *(OCR doc 03c)*. Modern
RepeatModeler names the same artifact `<sample>-families.fa`. **Both names refer to the same
thing** — the classified consensus library — and downstream documentation uses them
interchangeably.

### Sizing and failure modes

Total cores ≈ `WORKERS × THREADS`; on a 24-core / 124 GB box, `WORKERS=4` / `THREADS=6` is the
documented starting point. `WORK_DIR` runs **20-80 GB per genome in flight**.

- `STATE_DIR`/`WORK_DIR` on NFS → claim races become possible. Use local disk.
- `LTRSTRUCT=1` roughly doubles wall time and disk.
- A cgroup OOM kill from `MEM_LIMIT` looks like an ordinary failure in the log — check `dmesg`
  before believing one.
- Never `kill -9` a worker: it orphans claims and containers. They are recoverable on the next
  startup, but `status` is misleading until then.

---

## Stage 2 — Annotate TE locations genome-wide ✅

**In:** the stage 1 library + the genome FASTA. **Out:** a RepeatMasker `.out` table.
**Runtime:** typically an hour or two.

### As it runs now — the committed automation

Stage 2 is part of `repeat-modeler-automation/`, not a separate tool. Set `RUN_MASKER=1` in
`rmodeler.conf` and each worker masks every genome straight after it models it, in the same job
directory, using the library it just built:

```
RepeatMasker -lib <sample>-families.fa -pa $THREADS -xsmall <sample>.fa
```

| Flag | Why |
|---|---|
| `-lib` | Makes this a **custom library** run — the repeats annotated are the ones stage 1 discovered in this genome, not Dfam's stock set for the clade |
| `-pa $THREADS` | RepeatMasker's own parallelism. Unlike RepeatModeler there is no `-threads` spelling to detect; the container's `--cpus` ceiling applies on top |
| `-xsmall` | Soft-masks — repeats come back lowercased rather than replaced with `N`, so the masked FASTA is still usable as sequence for downstream motif scanning. No effect on the `.out` table |

**Outputs**

| Path | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `$OUT_DIR/<sample>.rm.out` | The annotation table. **This is what the rest of the project consumes.** It is RepeatMasker's own `<sample>.fa.out`, renamed on the way out so the role is visible |
| `$OUT_DIR/<sample>.rm.tbl` | RepeatMasker's summary table |
| `$OUT_DIR/<sample>.rm.masked.fa` | The soft-masked genome — only when `KEEP_MASKED_FASTA=1`, since it is as large as the genome |
| `$STATE_DIR/masked/<sample>` | Marker: masking finished successfully |
| `$LOG_DIR/<sample>.masker.log` | Full RepeatMasker output |

**Stage independence.** `done/` (modelled) and `masked/` are separate markers, and this is the
design point rather than an implementation detail:

- Turning `RUN_MASKER=1` on **after** a modelling run re-runs only RepeatMasker over the
  already-modelled genomes. The library is copied back from `$OUT_DIR`, which is the only place
  it survives once the job directory is deleted.
- A mask that fails keeps the `done/` marker and the library, so the retry costs one
  RepeatMasker run rather than another 8-26 hours.
- A SIGTERM mid-mask is an **abort**: no marker is written and the stage looks untouched next
  pass. It is never recorded as a failure.
- The stages log to separate files so a mask-only retry cannot truncate the RepeatModeler log
  belonging to the library it is using.

If the library is missing entirely — `done/` marker present but `<sample>-families.fa` gone —
the worker fails that genome with an explicit message rather than silently re-modelling it.
Clear `done/<sample>` to rebuild from scratch.

### As it ran originally ❌ (for reference)

The lab's own script, `runMasker.sh`, was never photographed and never committed, and the
automation does not attempt to reproduce it line for line. Two sources record what it did.

**The command** — lab notebook *(OCR doc 02, section 1)*:

```
Repeatmasker:
• After repeat modeler RM file w/date  Data D.
• consensi.fa.classified
• RepeatMasker
• Copy & paste replace Drosophila_…  w/ file
• RepeatMasker -lib RM_#$date/consensi.fa.classified -pa 8  Drosophila_ .fna file
```

`RM_#$date` stands for the dated RepeatModeler output directory — the real thing looks like
`RM_235549.ThuJul92144222026` *(OCR doc 03c)*. "Copy & paste replace Drosophila_… w/ file" is an
instruction to substitute the species filename by hand each time. **Treat the flag order as
approximate**; it is a handwritten paraphrase.

**The procedure** — Kaur write-up *(OCR doc 05, pages 2-3)*:

> 1.) Copy the RepeatModeler output (consensi.fa.classified) into the RepeatMasker folder (it
>     should already be there from when we ran RepeatModeler).
> 2.) Run RepeatMasker using the custom repeat library and the genome FASTA file.
> 3.) Save the output files for downstream analysis.

The parenthetical in step 1 is the operationally significant detail — RepeatMasker ran **in the
same per-species working directory as RepeatModeler**, so the library was already in place and
nothing was copied anywhere. The automation does exactly the same thing, for the same reason.

### Which container did this run in?

**The same image, not a separate one.** `dfam/tetools:latest` bundles RepeatMasker alongside
RepeatModeler, RECON, RepeatScout, TRF and rmblast. No second image is named anywhere in the
archive, and none is needed — which is what makes the write-up's *"it should already be there"*
true. The committed worker relies on this too: it runs both stages out of `RM_IMAGE`.

**A separate container instance, though.** Era 1's `spinContainer.sh` ran `-it --rm … bash`, so
the container died when the shell exited; and per the log, masking was handed to a collaborator
over OneDrive *(OCR doc 04)* — a different machine entirely. The committed worker also uses a
separate container per stage, named `<sample>-db`, `<sample>-rm` and `<sample>-mask`, so each
can be stopped by name on shutdown.

> **Open question, now only of historical interest.** Whether `runMasker.sh` was its own
> `docker run` wrapper or a script executed inside a shell started by `spinContainer.sh` is not
> established, and the script was never photographed. It no longer blocks anything — the
> automation supersedes both scripts — but it is the reason the original flag list cannot be
> confirmed.

**Committed example outputs** from era 1 are in `pipeline-scripts-output/DA_Files/` and
`pipeline-scripts-output/AnalysisForAll/FilesFromMasker/`, e.g.
`Drosophila_ananassae.GCF_017639315.1.rm.fna.out` — 39 MB and 297,073 lines.

---

## Stage 3 — Pair Cyp genes with nearby TEs ✅

**In:** annotation GFF3 + Cyp symbol list + RepeatMasker `.out`.
**Out:** one table per species. **Runtime:** seconds.

Three scripts in `pipeline-scripts-output/`, run in order. All three currently carry
**hardcoded absolute Windows paths at module scope** and take no arguments — the paths are
edited before each run. This is the residue of the era 1 procedure and is the single biggest
obstacle to automating the stage.

### 3a. `repeatOpp.py` — restrict the annotation to Cyp genes

Reads the annotation GFF3 and `Reg_Gene_Full.txt`; keeps a row if `fields[2] == "gene"` and a
target symbol appears anywhere in the attributes column. Writes `filtered.gff`.

> **Defect — row duplication.** One row is emitted per *matching symbol*, not per gene. A gene
> annotated `Name=Cyp313a5,Cyp313a2,Cyp313a3,Cyp313a1` is written four times. Measured on the
> committed *D. ananassae* example: **166 rows, 91 unique, 57 distinct gene names**, from 117
> gene records in. The duplication multiplies through stage 3b.

### 3b. `Locate_TE.py` — the actual TE-to-gene association

For each gene row, scans every line of the `.out` file and emits a row where the repeat falls
within the gene's span extended by 3,000 bp on each side.

The test, exactly as implemented:

```python
start = int(cypFields[3]) - 3000
stop  = int(cypFields[4]) + 3000
if cypFields[0] == eleFields[4] and (int(eleFields[6]) <= stop and int(eleFields[5]) >= start):
```

Two semantics worth being explicit about, because everything downstream inherits them:

> **The window is containment, not overlap.** The repeat must lie *entirely* inside
> `[gene_start - 3000, gene_end + 3000]`. A long element that straddles the window boundary —
> one that begins 4 kb upstream and runs into the gene — is **not** counted. For TE work this
> is the wrong default; overlap is the usual criterion.

> **`start` can go negative** for genes within 3 kb of the start of a sequence. Harmless in
> practice (no coordinate is ever below 1, so the comparison still succeeds) but it means the
> window is silently asymmetric for those genes.

Output `GenesAffectedByTEs.txt`: `<seqid> TAB <full gene attribute blob> TAB <raw .out line>`.
900 rows for *D. ananassae*.

Complexity is `O(genes × repeats)` with the repeat file held in memory — 91 genes × 297,073
repeats here. Fine at this scale; it will not survive a whole-genome gene set.

### 3c. `CleanAnnasse.py` — make column 2 readable

Replaces the 200-character attribute blob with the bare matched gene symbol, using the same
`Reg_Gene_Full.txt`. Output `DAnasse_TE_Cyp.txt` — 900 rows, 50 distinct genes.

The filename is hardcoded and species-specific; era 1 renamed the result by hand to
`D_<species>GenesAffectedByTE.txt` *(OCR doc 02, Step 3)*. The 29 files in
`AnalysisForAll/output/` are those renamings — including three hand-typing errors
(`D_secheliaGenesAffectedByT.txt`, `D_athabascaGenesAfffectedByTE.txt`,
`D_arawakanaGenesAffectedByTe.txt`).

### The era 1 procedure, for the record

From the lab notebook *(OCR doc 02)*, confirmed independently by the write-up *(OCR doc 05)*:

1. Open the script in VS Code, drag the species file in, paste the GFF path onto the
   highlighted line, convert Windows `\` to `/`, save, click run.
2. Copy the relative path of the RepeatMasker file, paste onto row 5, save, run again.
3. Right-click the output, name it `D_<species>GenesAffectedByTE.txt`, paste its relative path
   onto row 4, save, run again.

Three edit-save-run cycles per species, twenty-nine species.

---

## Stage 4 — Build the combined annotation ✅

**In:** stage 3 table + annotation GFF3 + genome sequence. **Out:** one combined GFF3 per
species. **Runtime:** minutes.

`analysis-pipeline/build_tfbs_te_gff 1.py`. Six internal phases:

1. Parse the stage 3 TE table into records, **de-duplicating** (compensating for the stage 3a
   defect above).
2. Parse the annotation GFF3, pulling `gene`, `mRNA` and `exon` features for the named genes.
3. Build scan windows: a promoter window around each TSS (`--upstream` / `--downstream`), and
   each TE interval ± `--te-flank`.
4. Extract sequence for those windows — from a local FASTA via a built-in dependency-free
   random-access reader, or from NCBI E-utils by accession (`--sequence-source ncbi`), which
   avoids downloading whole genomes.
5. Download or reuse the **JASPAR CORE Insects** non-redundant motif set, add the
   literature-derived **CncC:Maf-S** ARE motif, and run MEME Suite's `fimo` over the windows.
6. Remap FIMO's window-local coordinates back to absolute genome coordinates and write one
   sorted GFF3: `gene` → `mRNA` → `exon`/`intron`, plus `mobile_genetic_element` and
   `TF_binding_site`.

```bash
python "build_tfbs_te_gff 1.py" \
    --te-file D_suzukiiGenesAffectedByTE.txt \
    --gff dsuzukii_annotation.gff3 \
    --fasta dsuzukii_genome.fa \
    --output combined_cyp_annotation.gff3
```

Multiple species can instead be sections of one `species_config.ini`, selected with
`--config … --species suzukii`.

**External requirements and their fallbacks:**

| Need | Options |
|---|---|
| `fimo` (MEME Suite) | on `PATH`, or `--fimo-path`, or `--fimo-via-docker`, or `--skip-tfbs` to omit motif scanning |
| Genome sequence | local FASTA, or `--sequence-source ncbi` |
| `bgzip`/`tabix` | only for `--bgzip-index`; local or `--bgzip-via-docker` |

**`--skip-tfbs` has a downstream consequence**: the output then contains no `TF_binding_site`
records, and the CncC comparison in stage 6 has nothing to filter on for that species. The
`jaspar_cache/` directory visible in `Summer26/JBrowse_gff_creator/` *(OCR doc 03a)* confirms
the JASPAR download step really ran in era 1.

---

## Stage 5 — Visualise in JBrowse ✅ (manual)

**In:** combined GFF3 + genome FASTA. **Out:** a genome browser view. No script.

From the lab notebook *(OCR doc 02)* and write-up *(OCR doc 05)*:

1. Open new genome; adapter type **FastaAdapter**; genome from the `Dhakad → genomes` tree.
2. **Name the assembly after the species, nothing else.** A track can only attach to an
   assembly whose name matches, so this convention is load-bearing.
3. Add a track using the processed annotation file; select the matching assembly; load.

`build_tfbs_te_gff.py --bgzip-index` produces a bgzipped, tabix-indexed file loadable directly
as a JBrowse 2 GFF3Tabix track.

Saved sessions exist for three species only — `Dmelanogaster_simulans_sechellia.jbrowse`
*(OCR doc 03b)*.

---

## Stage 6 — Cross-species comparison ✅

**In:** one combined GFF3 per species + a config INI. **Out:** CSV, markdown report, plot.
**Runtime:** seconds.

Three scripts, same machinery, progressively narrower gene sets. Scripts 2 and 3 `import
compare_te_cyp_exposure`, so all three must sit in one directory **under importable names** —
see the filename caveat in [`04-gaps-and-provenance.md`](04-gaps-and-provenance.md).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    CFG["te_cyp_species_config.ini"] --> A
    A["compare_te_cyp_exposure.py<br/>ALL Cyp genes"]
    A --> B["compare_te_cyp_cncc.py<br/>Cyp genes near a CncC:Maf-S site"]
    A --> C["compare_te_cyp_xenobiotic.py<br/>curated resistance gene list"]
```

### How TEs are tied to genes here

Not by recomputing coordinate overlap. Stage 4 writes `Description=Within range of <symbol>`
onto every `mobile_genetic_element` record, and stage 6 reads the association straight out of
that attribute. **The 3 kb containment rule from stage 3b is therefore baked in** by the time
these scripts see the data, and cannot be changed here.

### Metrics computed per species

`n_cyp_genes`, `n_genes_with_te`, `pct_genes_with_te`, `total_te_count`, `total_cyp_bp`,
`te_per_kb`, `te_per_gene`. The last two exist to stop a species with more or longer Cyp genes
from appearing TE-rich merely by having more sequence to hit.

### Tests

Every individual Cyp gene, pooled across species, is one observation:

1. **Fisher's exact (two-tailed)** on `exposure group × gene has ≥1 TE` — tests TE *presence*.
2. **Mann-Whitney U** (normal approximation, tie-corrected) on per-gene TE *counts* — tests TE
   *burden*.

Both are pure-stdlib implementations, cross-validated against a second independently-coded
path by `--self-test`. A bootstrap over species clusters provides a confidence interval that
partially addresses the pooling problem.

```bash
python "compare_te_cyp_exposure 1 1.py" \
    --config te_cyp_species_config.ini \
    --output-csv te_cyp_summary.csv \
    --output-report te_cyp_report.md \
    --per-gene-csv te_cyp_per_gene.csv --plot

python "compare_te_cyp_exposure 1 1.py" --self-test     # stats validation only
```

### The two restricted variants

**`compare_te_cyp_cncc.py`** keeps only Cyp genes near a predicted CncC:Maf-S site — CncC is
the master regulator of Cyp-mediated detoxification, so this is the subset most directly
implicated in the hypothesis. It identifies those sites by `motif_source_id=CncC_Maf_ARE`
(unambiguous, since JASPAR hits carry `jaspar_matrix_id` instead), falling back to a `Name`
containing `cnc`. **Requires stage 4 to have run with motif scanning.** A species with zero
such records is reported as a **data gap**, explicitly, so it is not misread as "this species
has no CncC sites".

**`compare_te_cyp_xenobiotic.py`** keeps only genes on a plain-text, literature-curated list
(`--gene-list`) — the classic member being *Cyp6g1*. Matching is case-insensitive and **exact,
not partial**, so paralogs such as `Cyp12d1-d` and `Cyp12d1-p` must each be listed. It needs no
`TF_binding_site` records, so it works for species processed with `--skip-tfbs`. It also
reports which target genes were not found at all, which is the practical diagnostic for
cross-species naming mismatches.

### The caveat that is printed in every report

Pooling genes across species is **pseudoreplication** — genes within a species share a
phylogenetic and genomic background and are not independent observations. A species-level
comparison is also reported but, with a handful of species, is explicitly labelled descriptive
and exploratory rather than a formal test. This is stated in the generated output, not only
here.

> **Atallah Lab Spring 2026 Log**
>
> - January
>   - Fixed previous semester's code to replace gene names in each species annotation files
>     with D. melanogaster ortholog names
>   - Worked with Duy and Ayush, incorporating their work from the winter break
>     - Dataset #1 was produced using Ayush's edits to my old scripts
>       - Dataset in: CYP_Gene_Project/Spring26/Gff_Dataset#1
>       - Used NEW_Step_5_Replace_gff_Names_with_Dmelanogaster_1_9.py
>     - Dataset #2 was produced using Duy's scripts
>       - Dataset in CYP_Gene_Project/Spring/Gff_Dataset#2
>       - Used ReVamp_Final.py
>   - Made LBRN Poster for 24 January 2026 Meeting
> - February
>   - Began working to develop RepeatModeler2 procedure
>   - Attempted to replicate D. melanogaster TE library construction via RepeatModeler2 to
>     compare against Flynn et al paper results
> - March
>   - Developed pipeline for RepeatModeler2 -> RepeatMasker -> TFBS/Motif Analysis with Duy
>     and Charles
>     - RepeatModeler2
>       - Old: D:/CYP_Gene_Project/Dhakad_et_al_2025_Data_Analysis/12_species_genomes
>       - Main folder: CYP_Gene_Project/Spring26/Spring26RepeatModeler
>       - Shell scripting used to run RepeatModeler2 package for each species individually
>         - spinContainer.sh and runMasker.sh
>       - Generated folder for each species containing their genome file
>       - Once inside sh, used following commands:

Followed by a two-row boxed table:

```
BuildDatabase -name D_speciesname Species_genome_file.fa
RepeatModeler -database D_speciesname -threads 10 -LTRStruct
```

(`D_speciesname` and `Species_genome_file.fa` are italicised in the original — they are
placeholders.)

## Page 2 — verbatim

> - RepeatModeler2 runs could last anywhere from 8-26 hours, depending on the size of the
>   genome file
> - After completion, the new annotation file for that species ("_withDmelNames.gff") with
>   replaced D. melanogaster names for orthologs, was also placed in the folder ("For
>   RepeatMasker"), compressed, and sent to Duy/uploaded to OneDrive for RepeatMasker
>   processing
>
> - April & May
>   - Continued to develop pipeline and process data as analysis was completed
>   - Processed into individual folders, once uploaded to OneDrive (compressed, with gff)
>     for Duy, put into /For RepeatMasker
>   - Used various small scripts to clean up data and process into counts of relevant TEs
>   - Moved results from Duy and Charles into
>     D:/CYP_Gene_Proect/Spring26/RM2_RM_TFBS_Results
>     - excels (TEandTFdata.xls) for processed counts, others contain files for JBrowse for
>       D.melanogaster, D.sechellia, and D.simulans

(`CYP_Gene_Proect` is a typo in the original.)

> - *Drosophila melanogaster* standard
>   - Reran utilizing the same genome as Flynn et al paper, with the same parameters
>     (-LTRStruct, -srand 1570222393, -LTRMaxSeqLen 10000)
>   - Obtained 471 families
>   - Runtime: 12:39:21 (hh:mm:ss)
>   - Emailed corresponding authors of Flynn et al paper to inquire about any further
>     parameters used to obtain their total family count of 734
>     - Awaiting response
> - Due to backlog of RepeatModeler and processing of RepeatMasker files, I was not able to
>   get Charles any finished data for him to work on this week.

### Page 3 — handwritten additions

In black ink, mid-page, a four-item list:

```
annahassae
D mel
Simulans
Sechellia
```

In blue ink, lower left, two words that could not be read with confidence:

```
LSI maga   [?]
```

`annahassae` is *D. ananassae*. The blue annotation is illegible — it may be a name, a
note, or a signature. Do not guess at it.

### Page 3 — show-through

Page 3 is thin enough that the sheet behind it is faintly visible in mirror image. Several
`Families: <number>` lines and species names can be partly made out (`Drosophila
willistoni`, `Drosophila …`, values in the 400–1000 range, and further `Runtime:` lines in
`hh:mm:ss` form), which implies **a fourth log page exists listing per-species family
counts and runtimes**. That page was not photographed. [VERIFY — recover it if
per-species TE family counts are ever needed.]

## Notes

**People and ownership.** The log names five contributors and attributes specific artifacts:

| Person | Attributed work |
|---|---|
| (log author, i.e. Diljot Kaur — see doc 05) | Fixed the gene-renaming code; ran RepeatModeler2/RepeatMasker; kept this log; made the LBRN poster |
| Ayush | Winter-break edits to the author's older scripts → `NEW_Step_5_Replace_gff_Names_with_Dmelanogaster_1_9.py` → **Gff_Dataset#1** |
| Duy | `ReVamp_Final.py` → **Gff_Dataset#2**; co-developed the March pipeline; ran RepeatMasker processing |
| Charles | Co-developed the March pipeline; downstream RepeatMasker/TFBS result processing |
| Terry | Custom scripts (named in doc 05, role not detailed) |

**Two gene-renaming datasets exist, by two authors, months apart.** Nothing in the log says
which supersedes which. The notebook (doc 02) points its Step 1 at **Gff_Dataset#2**, so
that is the one in active use as of August 2026.

Both scripts have since been recovered, and the surviving per-species tables show that **both
were used** — 19 species through Duy's `ReVamp_Final.py` and 7 through Ayush's `NEW_Step_5_…`,
which do not produce the same result. The log's silence on the question turns out to be the
point rather than a gap in it: nobody chose. See
[`../scripts/06-final-final-gff.md`](../scripts/06-final-final-gff.md).

**The 8–26 hour figure is the load-bearing fact in this whole archive.** It explains the
shape of everything upstream of stage 3: a person opening a terminal per species, a container
that mounts one folder, ten species folders sitting side by side in doc 01's listing, and the
absence of any driver script. It is also why the first thing anyone tried to automate, in
September 2026, was this stage. The observed 45-hour run in doc 03c suggests the upper bound
is optimistic when `-LTRStruct` is on.

**The handoff was OneDrive, not a shared filesystem.** Annotation GFFs were renamed to
`*_withDmelNames.gff`, dropped in a `For RepeatMasker` folder, zipped, and uploaded for a
collaborator to collect. This is the origin of `evidence/analysis-scripts/OneDrive_1_9-1-2026.zip`
and of the doubled ` 1 1` filename suffixes discussed in doc 03a. It also means there was
never a single machine on which the whole pipeline ran end to end.

**The Flynn et al. benchmark is unresolved and material.** Same genome, same stated
parameters, **471 families against a published 734** — a 36% shortfall. The authors were
emailed; no response is recorded. Until that is closed out, per-species family counts from
this pipeline should be treated as a lower bound, not a measurement. Note also that
`-srand` is not a documented RepeatModeler flag as transcribed; it may be version-specific
or a transcription error. [VERIFY against `RepeatModeler --help` in the actual image.]

Scripts for testing whether Drosophila species with greater insecticide
exposure show more transposable element (TE) insertions in/near Cytochrome
P450 (Cyp) genes. Designed to run per-species, then compare across species.

## Pipeline order

```
 (per species, NOT included here — see "What's missing" below)
   genome FASTA
       -> gene annotation GFF3          (e.g. NCBI RefSeq, or BRAKER/MAKER)
       -> RepeatModeler + RepeatMasker  -> "genes affected by TE" table

                         |
                         v
1. build_tfbs_te_gff.py      per-species TE-hits table + annotation GFF3 + genome FASTA
                              -> one combined GFF3 (genes/exons/introns, TEs, predicted
                                 TF binding sites via JASPAR + MEME's fimo)
                         |
                         v
2. compare_te_cyp_exposure.py    combined GFF3s (all species) + config
                                  -> CSV + markdown report: TE burden vs. exposure group
                                     (Fisher's exact + Mann-Whitney U)
                         |
          +--------------+--------------+
          v                             v
3. compare_te_cyp_cncc.py      4. compare_te_cyp_xenobiotic.py
   same test, restricted to       same test, restricted to a literature-curated
   Cyp genes near a CncC:Maf-S    list of xenobiotic/insecticide-resistance
   antioxidant response motif     Cyp genes (e.g. Cyp6g1)
```

Scripts 3 and 4 both `import compare_te_cyp_exposure` for GFF3 parsing and
statistics, so all three must stay in the same directory.

### What's missing

These scripts do **not** start from a raw genome FASTA. `build_tfbs_te_gff.py`
only *parses* a pre-made RepeatMasker-style TE table and an existing gene
annotation GFF3 — it never runs gene annotation or RepeatModeler/RepeatMasker
itself. Those two artifacts have to be produced separately, per species,
before step 1 can run.

## 1. build_tfbs_te_gff.py

Builds the combined per-species GFF3 that everything downstream reads.

**Inputs**
- `--te-hits` (`--te-file`): RepeatMasker-derived "genes affected by TE"
  table (`<seqid> TAB <gene> TAB <RepeatMasker .out fields...>`)
- `--annotation-gff` (`--gff`): genome annotation GFF3 (gene/mRNA/exon)
- `--genome-fasta` (`--fasta`): genome FASTA, OR `--sequence-source ncbi`
  to fetch sequence windows from NCBI E-utils by accession instead

**Requires:** [MEME Suite](https://meme-suite.org) (`fimo`) on `PATH`, or
pass `--fimo-path`, or `--fimo-via-docker`. Use `--skip-tfbs` to skip motif
scanning entirely and just merge genes/exons/TEs.

```bash
python "build_tfbs_te_gff 1.py" \
    --te-file D_suzukiiGenesAffectedByTE.txt \
    --gff dsuzukii_annotation.gff3 \
    --fasta dsuzukii_genome.fa \
    --output combined_cyp_annotation.gff3
```

Multiple species can instead be defined as `[section]`s of one
`species_config.ini` (`te_hits=`, `annotation_gff=`, `genome_fasta=`, ...)
and selected with `--config species_config.ini --species suzukii`.

Optional `--bgzip-index` bgzip/tabix-indexes the output for loading into
JBrowse 2.

## 2. compare_te_cyp_exposure.py

Reads the combined GFF3 from step 1 for each species and tests whether TE
burden in Cyp genes correlates with exposure group.

**Config file** (`--config te_cyp_species_config.ini`), one `[section]` per
species:

```ini
[d_suzukii]
gff = combined_cyp_annotation_suzukii.gff3
exposure = high          ; must be "high" or "low"
gene_name_pattern = ^Cyp   ; optional, defaults to matching all `gene` records
```

```bash
python "compare_te_cyp_exposure 1 1.py" \
    --config te_cyp_species_config.ini \
    --output-csv te_cyp_summary.csv \
    --output-report te_cyp_report.md \
    --per-gene-csv te_cyp_per_gene.csv \
    --plot
```

Run `--self-test` to just cross-validate the stdlib-only Fisher's exact /
Mann-Whitney U implementations and exit.

**Caveat reported in the output:** pooling genes across species is
pseudoreplication (genes within a species aren't independent). A secondary,
purely descriptive species-level comparison is included but not treated as
a formal test.

## 3. compare_te_cyp_cncc.py

Same comparison as script 2, restricted to Cyp genes sitting near a
predicted CncC:Maf-S (Cap-n-Collar) antioxidant/xenobiotic response motif —
the master regulator of Cyp-mediated detoxification. Requires `TF_binding_site`
records in the GFF3, which only exist if step 1 was run *with* FIMO motif
scanning (not `--skip-tfbs`). Species with zero such records are reported as
a **data gap**, not a biological "no CncC sites" finding.

```bash
python "compare_te_cyp_cncc 1 1.py" --config te_cyp_species_config.ini --plot
```

## 4. compare_te_cyp_xenobiotic.py

Same comparison as script 2, restricted to a literature-curated gene list
(e.g. `Cyp6g1`, the classic Accord-TE-insertion DDT/neonicotinoid resistance
case) instead of every Cyp gene. Doesn't need `TF_binding_site` records, so
it works even for species run with `--skip-tfbs`.

```bash
python "compare_te_cyp_xenobiotic 1 1.py" \
    --config te_cyp_species_config.ini \
    --gene-list xenobiotic_resistance_cyp_genes.txt
```

The gene list is a plain-text file, one symbol per line, `# comment` allowed.
Matching is case-insensitive and exact — paralogs (e.g. `Cyp12d1-d` vs.
`Cyp12d1-p`) must be listed individually.

## Known gaps in this delivery

- **No upstream annotation/repeat-masking step.** As noted above, the
  RepeatMasker table and annotation GFF3 that `build_tfbs_te_gff.py` needs
  are not produced by anything here.
- **Example config/list files referenced but not present.** All four
  scripts point to `species_config.example.ini`,
  `te_cyp_species_config.example.ini`, and
  `xenobiotic_resistance_cyp_genes.example.txt` for filled-in templates —
  none of these currently exist in this directory. You'll need to create
  your own following the formats documented above (or in each script's
  module docstring).
- Filenames carry stray ` 1` / ` 1 1` suffixes (e.g. `build_tfbs_te_gff 1.py`) —
  Windows duplicate-file renames picked up on round trips through zip and
  OneDrive. **As delivered, scripts 3 and 4 cannot import script 2**, so two
  of the three comparisons could never have run in this form. Whatever
  results exist were produced from some copy under importable names, and
  that copy is not in the archive.
